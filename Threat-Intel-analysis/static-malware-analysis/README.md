## 🧪 INTRODUCTION

This project documents a static malware analysis of a suspicious Windows Portable Executable (PE) file.
The goal was to analyze the sample without execution, identify indicators of malicious intent, and strengthen my understanding of Windows internals, binary structures, and malware research techniques.

This work is part of my ongoing study into system security, logging, and threat detection.
By examining the internal composition of the sample, I aim to develop a deeper, technical foundation for future dynamic and behavioral analysis.

## 🕵️ What I'll learn

Through this analysis, I set out to:
- Perform a complete static examination of a suspicious executable to understand its structure and purpose
- Work hands-on with industry tools such as CFF Explorer, PEStudio, HxD, and HashMyFiles
- Understand how malware is classified and named, and what these conventions reveal about its behavior
- Check digital authenticity, by verifying whether the executable includes a valid code-signing certificate
- Extract early Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that can guide deeper dynamic analysis later on

## 🛠️Tools used 
- HashMyFiles
- CFF Explorer
- HxD
- Exeinfo PE
- PEStudio
- FlareVM Strings Utility

⚠️ All analysis was performed manually in a safe, isolated virtual environment.

## 🕵️ Key Takeaways

- Static analysis provides valuable insights before execution
- Unsigned binaries should always be treated as suspicious
- Legitimate components can be repurposed for malicious use
- Understanding Windows internals and PE structure is fundamental to effective malware analysis

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Perform dynamic analysis in a sandboxed VM to observe real-time behavior
2. Capture network traffic with Wireshark and correlate with extracted IOCs
3. Use Sysmon and Wazuh for event correlation and process tracking
4. Develop custom YARA rules and detection signatures based on findings
