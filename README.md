## 🧩 Personal Projects  

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity projects repository!  
I’m a cybersecurity student who's especially drawn to **threat intellegence**, **automation** and **digital forensics**.
I build small projects like these to learn by experience. 

## 🚀 Featured Projects  

### 🧠 [Automated Threat Detection Workflow](./Automated-threat-detection-workflow)
An automation-focused project showing how alert data can be enriched and summarized automatically using **Splunk**, **n8n**, **Claude (AI)**, and **Slack**.
- Detects brute-force attempts in Splunk  
- Enriches data via AbuseIPDB and VirusTotal
- Uses AI to summarize incidents  
- Sends actionable alerts to Slack  

📸 *Includes screenshots, architecture diagram, and documentation*

### 🕵️ [Threat Intel Analysis](./Threat-Intel-analysis)
A folder containing different threat intelligence analyses and case studies.
Each analysis focuses on extracting and enriching Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to understand attacker behavior.
Currently includes:
- Static malware analysis: examining samples to extract hashes, IPs, domains, and strings
- Compromised WordPress investigation: analyzing logs and network activity to identify potential compromise paths
