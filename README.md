# 🧩 Personal Projects  

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity projects repository!  
This collection includes hands-on work and experiments I've built to learn and showcase my skills in **SOC automation**, **threat intelligence**, and **incident analysis**.

## 🚀 Featured Projects  

### 🧠 [Automated SOC Workflow](./Automated-SOC-Workflow)
Build an end-to-end automated SOC pipeline using **Splunk**, **n8n**, **AI**, and **Slack**.  
- Detects brute-force attempts in Splunk  
- Enriches data via AbuseIPDB  
- Uses AI to summarize incidents  
- Sends actionable alerts to Slack  

📸 *Includes screenshots, architecture diagram, and documentation*

### 🕵️ [Threat Intel Analysis](./Threat-Intel-analysis)
A malware static analysis and threat intelligence project focusing on extracting, enriching, and understanding Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
- Performs static analysis on malware samples to extract hashes, domains, IPs, and strings
- Uses OSINT APIs (e.g., VirusTotal) for enrichment
- Provides summarized threat intelligence on the analyzed samples
  
💡 Goal: bridge malware analysis and threat intelligence — turning raw samples into actionable security insights.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning  
- Log analysis & detection engineering – investigating system and security logs to find suspicious activity
- Threat intelligence – collecting, enriching, and correlating IOCs from OSINT and malware samples
- SOC automation workflows – integrating Splunk, n8n, and APIs to streamline alert handling
- API & OSINT integration – using platforms like VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, and Shodan for enrichment
- Security documentation & reporting – building clear, actionable summaries of incidents and alerts
